        <p className="pb-6">The Bachelor of Marine Information Systems Study Program was established on February 1, 2019, under the auspices of UPI BHMN, as per Decree number 4090/UN40/HK/2019. The creation of the Marine Information Systems (SIK) Study Program was spearheaded by the administrative and academic leadership at UPI Campus in Serang, who were responsible for the program's proposal. Drs. Salim, M.Ed., Ph.D, assumed the role of Director of UPI Campus in Serang, while Dr. Encep Supriatna held the position of Deputy Director. Simultaneously, the academic team, comprising Ferry Dwi Cahyadi, S.Pd., M.Sc, Kukuh Widiyanto, S.Pd., M.Sc, and Novi Sofia Fitriasari, M.T, played a pivotal role in this initiative.</p>
        <p className="pb-6">The Marine Information Systems Study Program at UPI Campus in Serang, established in 2019, holds the distinction of being the inaugural non-educational study program at the UPI Regional Campus Serang. Moreover, it stands as the sole study program in Indonesia bearing the appellation "Marine Information System". Undoubtedly, this nomenclature poses distinct challenges in terms of introducing the study program on local, national, and international platforms. The inception of this study program emanated from a profound aspiration to align with the government's vision for advancing Indonesia within the framework of the World Maritime Axis. This endeavor leverages the advancements in information systems during the era of the Fourth Industrial Revolution. </p>
