                <p className="pb-6"> Marine Information System Program is a part of Marine Science, focusing on the analysis of marine data, both numeric and spatial, which is then integrated into an information system basis for decision-making. Based on this, the study areas of the program consist of five fields:</p>

                <p className="pb-4"><span>1. </span>Marine Science</p>
                <p className="pb-4"><span>2. </span>Fisheries Science</p>
                <p className="pb-4"><span>3. </span>Information System</p>
                <p className="pb-4"><span>4. </span>Geographic Information Systems</p>
                <p className="pb-4"><span>5. </span>Remote Sensing in Marine and Oceanography</p>

                <p className="pb-6">The total credit hours required for students in the Marine Information Systems program is 146 credit hours, as follows:</p>
            
                <p className="pb-4"><span>1. </span>General Courses (MKU) = 14 credits</p>
